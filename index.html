            The Magic 8-Ball is a plastic sphere, made to look like an eight-ball, that is used for fortune-telling or seeking advice. It was invented in 1950 by Albert C. Carter and Abe Bookman. The user asks a yesâ€“no question to the ball and then turns it over to reveal an answer in a window on the ball. The 20 possible answers inside a standard Magic 8-Ball are: 10 of the possible answers are affirmative, 5 are non-committal, and 5 are negative.
